# AI-Model-for-Early-Disease-Detection
The goal of this project is to design an AI system that uses medical imaging to predict early-stage diseases. For example, you could focus on breast cancer detection using mammogram images or Alzheimer's detection from MRI scans. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes, so this project would be impactful in the healthcare domain.
